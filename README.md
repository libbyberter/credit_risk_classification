In this analysis, a large dataset of loan information was used to build a prediction model to identify healthy loans vs unhealthy loans.  The dataset contained data on loan amount & interest rate as well as borrower information such as income, debt ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and their total debt.  The result of the loan (healthy/unhealthy) was also in the data set which allowed us to use supervised learning models.  The data included information on 77,536 loans with 95% of the loans being healthy loans.

For the analysis, the dataset was split into a training set and then a set to test the model with.  A Logistic Regression model was built and analyzed.  Due to the imbalance in the type of loans in the dataset, oversampling was utilized and a second model created.  The second model yielded better results than the first.
